# eventor-api-openapi-spec

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/mikaello/eventor-api-openapi-spec.svg?branch=main&status=passed)](https://travis-ci.com/github/mikaello/eventor-api-openapi-spec)

OpenAPI spec / Swagger for the Eventor API: [eventor-api.yml](./eventor-api.yml).

You can browse the Swagger UI, but it will not work because of CORS. You can use it to browse and create cURL commands that you can execute in your own terminal. Or you could import the OpenAPI spec into Postman and make your calls from there.
